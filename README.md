The mkdir system call is used to create a directory in the file system.

Code
c
Copy code
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char *path = "./example_dir";
    int status = mkdir(path, 0755); // Permissions: rwxr-xr-x
    if (status == 0) {
        printf("Directory created: %s\n", path);
    } else {
        perror("mkdir failed");
    }
    return 0;
}
Output Example

    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("open failed");
        return 1;
    }

    const char *text = "Hello, world!\n";
    write(fd, text, 13); // Write to the file

    lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET); // Move to start of file

    char buffer[14] = {0};

Here is a demonstration of process-related system calls in the requested format:

1. fork() System Call
Aim
Create a new process.

Description
The fork() system call is used to create a child process. The child process is an exact copy of the parent process, except for the returned value.

Parent process: Returns the child’s process ID.
Child process: Returns 0.
Error: Returns -1.
Code
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork failed");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent process: PID = %d, Child PID = %d\n", getpid(), pid);
    }
    return 0;
}
Output Analysis
Command:
./fork_demo

Output:

arduino
Copy code
Parent process: PID = 12345, Child PID = 12346
Child process: PID = 12346
Explanation:

The parent process prints its PID and the child’s PID.
The child process prints its own PID.
2. getpid() System Call
Aim
Retrieve the process ID (PID) of the current process.

Description
The getpid() system call returns the PID of the calling process. It never fails.

Code
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = getpid();
    printf("Current Process ID: %d\n", pid);
    return 0;
}
Output Analysis
Command:
./getpid_demo

Output:

arduino
Copy code
Current Process ID: 12345
Explanation:
The output displays the unique PID assigned to the current process.

3. getppid() System Call

Retrieve the parent process ID (PPID) of the current process.

Description
The getppid() system call returns the PID of the parent process.

Code
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t ppid = getppid();
    printf("Parent Process ID: %d\n", ppid);
    return 0;
}
Output Analysis
Command:
./getppid_demo

Output:

yaml
Copy code
Parent Process ID: 6789
Explanation:
The output shows the PID of the parent process that spawned the current process.

4. exec() System Call
Aim
Replace the current process image with a new process image.

Description
The exec() family of system calls replaces the current process with a new executable. Variants include execl, execp, execv, etc.

On success: Does not return.
On failure: Returns -1.
Code
c
Copy code
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char *path = "/bin/ls";
    char *const args[] = {"ls", "-l", NULL};
    if (execv(path, args) == -1) {
        perror("exec failed");
        return 1;
    }
    return 0; // This line is never reached if exec succeeds.
}
Output Analysis
Command:
./exec_demo

Output:

sql
Copy code
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1024 Nov 25 10:00 example_file.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Nov 25 10:00 example_dir
Explanation:
The execv call replaces the current process, running the ls -l command instead.

5. wait() System Call
Aim
Suspend execution of the parent process until the child process terminates.

Description
The wait() system call makes the parent process wait for its child to finish execution.

Returns the PID of the terminated child on success.
Returns -1 on error.
Code
c
Copy code
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork failed");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process running: PID = %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(2); // Simulate work
        return 0;
    } else {
        int status;
        printf("Parent process waiting for child...\n");
        pid_t child_pid = wait(&status);
        if (child_pid == -1) {
            perror("wait failed");
            return 1;
        }
        printf("Child process terminated: PID = %d, Status = %d\n", child_pid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
    }
    return 0;
}
Output Analysis
Command:
./wait_demo

Output:

arduino
Copy code
Parent process waiting for child...
Child process running: PID = 12346
Child process terminated: PID = 12346, Status = 0
Explanation:

The parent waits until the child completes its task.
The child terminates and returns status 0.
By following this structure, we provide concise explanations, error handling, and clear output analysis for each system call. Let me know if you need further clarification!

CPU Scheduling Algorithms Implementation
Aim
To implement CPU scheduling algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Each algorithm will be implemented in Python without using external libraries, calculating Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), Waiting Time (WT), and Response Time (RT). Additionally, Gantt charts will be presented for each algorithm.

Algorithm Descriptions
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
Description:
Processes are executed in the order they arrive. No preemption is involved. The process that arrives first is executed first.
Characteristics: Non-preemptive.
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
Description:
Processes are executed based on their burst time. The process with the shortest burst time is executed first.
Characteristics: Non-preemptive.
3. Round Robin (RR)
Description:
Processes are executed in a cyclic order, using a fixed time quantum. If a process does not complete within the time quantum, it is moved to the back of the queue.
Characteristics: Preemptive.

Page Replacement Algorithms Implementation
Aim
To implement Page Replacement Algorithms:

First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
Least Recently Used (LRU)
Each algorithm will simulate page replacement in a memory management system. The output includes the number of Page Hits, Page Faults, and the sequence of memory frames during execution.

Algorithm Descriptions
1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
Description:
Pages are replaced in the order they were loaded into memory. When a page fault occurs and memory is full, the oldest page in memory is replaced.
Characteristics: Simple, but may result in Belady's anomaly.
2. Least Recently Used (LRU)
Description:
Pages that have not been used for the longest time are replaced first. The algorithm tracks the usage history of pages.
Characteristics: Reduces page faults compared to FIFO, but slightly more complex to implement.
Python Implementation

Frame Size: 3

1. FIFO Execution
Memory initially empty.
Load pages sequentially, replacing the oldest page when full.
Gantt Chart (Frames at each step):
| Step | Frames | Action | |------|---------|-----------------| | 1 | [7] | Page Fault | | 2 | [7, 0] | Page Fault | | 3 | [7, 0, 1]| Page Fault | | 4 | [0, 1, 2]| Replace 7 | | 5 | [0, 1, 2]| Hit 0 | | ... | | |
2. LRU Execution
Memory initially empty.
Replace least recently used page on a fault.
Gantt Chart (Frames at each step):
| Step | Frames | Action | |------|---------|-----------------| | 1 | [7] | Page Fault | | 2 | [7, 0] | Page Fault | | 3 | [7, 0, 1]| Page Fault | | 4 | [0, 1, 2]| Replace 7 | | 5 | [0, 1, 2]| Hit 0 | | ... | | |
Output Analysis
FIFO: May cause more page faults due to Belady’s anomaly. Older pages are evicted without considering future references.
LRU: Tracks usage history, resulting in fewer page faults for many scenarios but incurs additional overhead.

Threading in Programming
Aim
To illustrate the usage of threads in programming through basic examples and explain thread-related system calls and concepts.

Description of Threads
A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same resources, such as memory and file descriptors. Threads are used to perform tasks concurrently within a program, making it more efficient, especially in multitasking environments.

Types of Threads
User Threads: Managed by user-level libraries without kernel support.
Kernel Threads: Managed directly by the operating system kernel.
Advantages of Threads
Efficiency: Threads are lightweight and faster to create than processes.
Concurrency: Allows tasks to run in parallel, improving program responsiveness and performance.
Resource Sharing: Threads in the same process share the same memory space, making communication between them easier and faster.
Threading Concepts
Thread Creation: A thread is created within a process and shares the same resources.
Thread Synchronization: Ensures that multiple threads do not interfere with each other when accessing shared resources. Techniques like mutexes and semaphores are used for synchronization.
Thread Lifecycle: Threads can be in states like ready, running, waiting, or terminated.
Code Examples to Illustrate Threading
1. Thread Creation (Using Python threading module)
Code
python
Copy code
import threading
import time

def print_hello():
    print("Hello from thread")

def print_goodbye():
    print("Goodbye from thread")

# Creating threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_hello)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_goodbye)

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Main thread execution complete")
Explanation
The threading.Thread() method is used to create threads.
The start() method starts the thread execution.
The join() method ensures the main program waits for thread completion before exiting.
Output
arduino
Copy code
Hello from thread
Goodbye from thread
Main thread execution complete
2. Threads with Delays (Simulating Multiple Tasks)
Code
python
Copy code
import threading
import time

def task(name, delay):
    print(f"Task {name} started")
    time.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {name} completed after {delay} seconds")

# Creating threads with different sleep times
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("A", 2))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task, args=("B", 1))

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("All tasks completed")
Explanation
Two threads are created to execute task with different delay times.
The task function simulates some work by using time.sleep().
Output
css
Copy code
Task A started
Task B started
Task B completed after 1 seconds
Task A completed after 2 seconds
All tasks completed
3. Thread Synchronization (Using Locking)
Code
python
Copy code
import threading

# Shared resource
counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:
            counter += 1

# Creating multiple threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
Explanation
The lock ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource (counter) at a time, preventing race conditions.
Using with lock:, we acquire and release the lock automatically.
Output
sql
Copy code
Final counter value: 200000
4. Using Daemon Threads (Background Execution)
Code
python
Copy code
import threading
import time

def background_task():
    while True:
        print("Daemon thread running")
        time.sleep(2)

# Creating a daemon thread
daemon_thread = threading.Thread(target=background_task, daemon=True)

# Starting daemon thread
daemon_thread.start()

# Main thread sleep
time.sleep(5)

print("Main thread completed")
Explanation
Daemon threads run in the background and terminate when the main program exits.
daemon=True is used to make a thread a daemon thread.
Output
arduino
Copy code
Daemon thread running
Daemon thread running
Daemon thread running
Main thread completed
(Note: The daemon thread stops when the main program ends.)

Mathematical Example (Illustrating Thread Usage)
Let's consider a scenario where we have a task that involves processing multiple datasets concurrently. By creating multiple threads, we can process different datasets in parallel, reducing the total execution time.

Given:
Task 1: Takes 5 seconds to process
Task 2: Takes 3 seconds to process
Task 3: Takes 2 seconds to process
If we execute them sequentially, the total time would be 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 seconds.
However, with threading, we can execute them concurrently, resulting in a total time of 5 seconds (longest task).

Output Analysis
Concurrency: Threads allow the simultaneous execution of tasks, making programs faster for I/O-bound tasks and improving responsiveness.
Synchronization: When multiple threads access shared data, synchronization (locks) ensures no conflicts arise.
Daemon Threads: Useful for background tasks, where the program can exit without waiting for them to finish.
Conclusion
Threads are essential for concurrent programming, enabling tasks to be performed simultaneously.
Synchronization ensures that threads operate safely on shared data.
Daemon threads can run background tasks, ensuring efficient program flow.

Demonstrating the Use of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms in GNU/Linux Using Pipes and Shared Memory
Aim
To demonstrate the use of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms in GNU/Linux, specifically Pipes and Shared Memory, showcasing how processes can communicate and share data effectively.

Description of IPC Mechanisms
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) refers to the techniques used by processes to communicate with each other and share data. These mechanisms enable efficient data exchange and synchronization among processes. In Linux, two common IPC methods are Pipes and Shared Memory.

Pipes: A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel that allows data to flow from one process to another. It is a mechanism that connects the standard output of one process to the standard input of another. Pipes are commonly used for simple communication between related processes, such as a parent and child process.

Anonymous Pipe: Used for communication between related processes.
Named Pipe (FIFO): Can be used by unrelated processes and exists as a special file in the filesystem.
Shared Memory: Shared memory is a method of IPC where two or more processes can access the same portion of memory. It allows processes to read and write to the same memory space directly, providing high-speed communication. However, synchronization mechanisms like semaphores or mutexes are typically needed to manage access to the shared memory to avoid data corruption.

Code Demonstrations
1. IPC Using Pipes
Description of Pipes:
Pipes provide a one-way communication channel between processes.
A pipe is created using the pipe() system call, which returns two file descriptors—one for reading and one for writing.
Data written by one process to the write end of the pipe can be read by another process from the read end.
Code: Demonstrating Pipe (Parent-Child Communication)
python
Copy code
import os

def child_process(pipe_out):
    data = "Hello from child process!"
    os.write(pipe_out, data.encode())  # Writing data to pipe
    os.close(pipe_out)

def parent_process(pipe_in):
    data = os.read(pipe_in, 1024)  # Reading data from pipe
    print(f"Parent received: {data.decode()}")
    os.close(pipe_in)

# Create a pipe
pipe_in, pipe_out = os.pipe()

# Fork the process
pid = os.fork()

if pid > 0:
    # Parent Process
    os.close(pipe_out)  # Parent does not need write end
    parent_process(pipe_in)
else:
    # Child Process
    os.close(pipe_in)  # Child does not need read end
    child_process(pipe_out)
Explanation:
The os.pipe() function creates a pipe, and os.fork() creates a child process.
The parent process reads data from the pipe, while the child process writes data to the pipe.
The communication occurs via the pipe, allowing the parent to receive the message from the child.
Output:
arduino
Copy code
Parent received: Hello from child process!
2. IPC Using Shared Memory
Description of Shared Memory:
Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the same memory space.
It's a fast IPC mechanism but requires synchronization to avoid race conditions.
In Linux, shared memory is often managed using the shmget(), shmat(), and shmdt() system calls.
Code: Demonstrating Shared Memory (Two Processes Communication)
python
Copy code
import os
import sys
import mmap

def writer(shared_mem):
    # Writing data to shared memory
    shared_mem.write(b"Hello from writer process!")

def reader(shared_mem):
    # Reading data from shared memory
    print(f"Reader process received: {shared_mem[:]}")

def main():
    # Create a shared memory object
    shared_mem = mmap.mmap(-1, 1024)  # Allocate 1024 bytes of shared memory

    pid = os.fork()

    if pid > 0:
        # Parent Process - Reader
        os.wait()  # Wait for child to finish
        reader(shared_mem)
        shared_mem.close()
    else:
        # Child Process - Writer
        writer(shared_mem)
        os._exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
mmap.mmap() creates a shared memory region.
The child writes a message to the shared memory, and the parent reads the message.
This example demonstrates the use of shared memory for communication between the child and parent processes.
Output:
arduino
Copy code
Reader process received: b'Hello from writer process!'
IPC Mechanism Analysis
Mechanism	Use Case	Speed	Synchronization	Data Flow
Pipes	Best for communication between related processes (e.g., parent-child)	Moderate (due to OS buffering)	Simple (unidirectional)	One-way (can be unidirectional)
Shared Memory	Suitable for high-speed communication between unrelated processes	Very fast (direct memory access)	Complex (requires semaphores or mutexes)	Bidirectional (both read and write access)
Advantages of Pipes:
Simple to implement.
Suitable for parent-child process communication.
Disadvantages of Pipes:
One-way communication.
Limited to related processes (parent-child).
Advantages of Shared Memory:
Fast communication as processes directly access memory.
Suitable for complex communication between unrelated processes.
Disadvantages of Shared Memory:
Synchronization is needed to avoid race conditions.
More complex to implement and manage.
Conclusion
Pipes and Shared Memory are powerful IPC mechanisms available in Linux for communication between processes.
Pipes are simpler to implement and are used in scenarios like parent-child communication, while Shared Memory allows faster and more flexible communication between processes, albeit requiring synchronization mechanisms to avoid data corruption.

Implementation of Classical Problems for Synchronization: Dining Philosopher Problem and Producer-Consumer Problem
Aim
To implement and demonstrate the classical synchronization problems in operating systems, Dining Philosopher Problem and Producer-Consumer Problem, showcasing the need for proper synchronization between processes to avoid deadlock, race conditions, and resource starvation.

Description of Problems
Dining Philosopher Problem:

This problem is used to model synchronization issues related to multiple processes accessing shared resources. The problem involves a set of philosophers sitting at a dining table, where each philosopher thinks and occasionally eats. However, to eat, a philosopher needs two resources (forks), which are shared with neighboring philosophers.
Challenge: Proper synchronization is needed to avoid deadlock (where no philosopher can eat) and ensure that all philosophers get a chance to eat.
Solution: The problem is usually solved using mutexes or semaphores to control access to shared resources (forks).
Producer-Consumer Problem:

The Producer-Consumer problem involves two processes (Producer and Consumer) sharing a common, finite-size buffer. The producer adds data to the buffer, and the consumer takes data from it. The challenge is ensuring that the producer doesn’t add data to the full buffer and that the consumer doesn’t consume from an empty buffer.
Challenge: Proper synchronization is needed to prevent race conditions, such as the producer trying to add data to a full buffer or the consumer trying to consume from an empty one.
Solution: This problem is typically solved using semaphores or condition variables to signal between the producer and consumer when the buffer is full or empty.
1. Dining Philosopher Problem
Code: Using Semaphores for Synchronization
python
Copy code
import threading
import time

# Number of philosophers
N = 5
# Shared resources (forks)
forks = [threading.Semaphore(1) for _ in range(N)]

# Semaphore to prevent deadlock and control the number of philosophers eating
mutex = threading.Semaphore(1)

def philosopher(i):
    while True:
        # Think
        print(f"Philosopher {i} is thinking.")
        time.sleep(2)

        # Pick up forks (left and right)
        left_fork = i
        right_fork = (i + 1) % N
        
        mutex.acquire()  # Ensure no two philosophers pick up the same fork at the same time
        forks[left_fork].acquire()  # Pick up left fork
        forks[right_fork].acquire()  # Pick up right fork
        mutex.release()
        
        # Eat
        print(f"Philosopher {i} is eating.")
        time.sleep(1)

        # Put down forks
        forks[left_fork].release()
        forks[right_fork].release()
        print(f"Philosopher {i} finished eating.")

# Create threads for philosophers
threads = []
for i in range(N):
    t = threading.Thread(target=philosopher, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to finish
for t in threads:
    t.join()
Explanation:
Each philosopher is represented as a thread.
A semaphore is used to represent each fork, and the mutex ensures mutual exclusion for picking up forks.
The philosopher alternates between thinking and eating, acquiring and releasing the forks as necessary.
Proper synchronization prevents deadlock by ensuring that no two philosophers try to pick up the same fork simultaneously.
Output:
csharp
Copy code
Philosopher 0 is thinking.
Philosopher 1 is thinking.
Philosopher 2 is thinking.
Philosopher 3 is thinking.
Philosopher 4 is thinking.
Philosopher 0 is eating.
Philosopher 1 is eating.
Philosopher 2 is eating.
...
Output Analysis:
Each philosopher gets a chance to think and eat without causing deadlock or race conditions due to synchronization.
The semaphores ensure that only one philosopher can access a fork at a time, avoiding resource contention.
2. Producer-Consumer Problem
Code: Using Semaphores for Synchronization
python
Copy code
import threading
import time
import random

# Buffer size and the buffer itself
BUFFER_SIZE = 5
buffer = []
empty = threading.Semaphore(BUFFER_SIZE)
full = threading.Semaphore(0)
mutex = threading.Semaphore(1)

def producer():
    while True:
        item = random.randint(1, 100)  # Produce an item
        empty.acquire()  # Wait for an empty space in the buffer
        mutex.acquire()  # Lock the buffer for adding the item
        buffer.append(item)
        print(f"Produced: {item}. Buffer: {buffer}")
        mutex.release()  # Release the lock on the buffer
        full.release()  # Signal that the buffer has a full slot
        time.sleep(random.randint(1, 3))  # Simulate time delay

def consumer():
    while True:
        full.acquire()  # Wait for a full slot in the buffer
        mutex.acquire()  # Lock the buffer for consuming the item
        item = buffer.pop(0)
        print(f"Consumed: {item}. Buffer: {buffer}")
        mutex.release()  # Release the lock on the buffer
        empty.release()  # Signal that the buffer has an empty slot
        time.sleep(random.randint(1, 3))  # Simulate time delay

# Create threads for producer and consumer
producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer)
consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer)

producer_thread.start()
consumer_thread.start()

producer_thread.join()
consumer_thread.join()
Explanation:
The producer generates items and places them in the buffer, while the consumer takes items out of the buffer.
Semaphores are used to ensure that the buffer is not overfilled or emptied beyond its limits.
The mutex is used to prevent race conditions when accessing the shared buffer.
The empty semaphore represents the empty slots in the buffer, and the full semaphore represents the filled slots.
Output:
makefile
Copy code
Produced: 53. Buffer: [53]
Consumed: 53. Buffer: []
Produced: 12. Buffer: [12]
Consumed: 12. Buffer: []
...
Output Analysis:
The producer adds items to the buffer, and the consumer removes them.
The semaphores prevent buffer overflow or underflow by ensuring the producer and consumer operate within the buffer's constraints.
The mutex ensures that the producer and consumer don't access the buffer simultaneously, preventing data corruption.
Conclusion
Both the Dining Philosopher Problem and the Producer-Consumer Problem are classic examples of synchronization problems that arise in concurrent programming. By using semaphores for mutual exclusion and signaling, we can avoid deadlock, race conditions, and resource contention. Proper synchronization allows processes to work together effectively while sharing resources. These implementations serve as an introduction to more advanced concepts in concurrency control in operating systems.

Implementation of Bankers algorithm for Deadlock detection and avoidance

Implementation of Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Detection and Avoidance
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to implement Banker's Algorithm, which is used for Deadlock Detection and Avoidance in operating systems. The algorithm ensures that the system will not enter into an unsafe state by allocating resources in a manner that avoids deadlock situations.

Description of Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that checks whether the system is in a safe state before granting resource requests. The key concept behind this algorithm is to check if resources can be allocated in a way that ensures all processes will eventually be able to complete without entering a deadlock state.

How it works:
Safe State: A state is considered safe if there exists a sequence of processes such that each process can get its maximum required resources, execute, release the resources, and allow the next process in the sequence to execute, until all processes have completed their execution.
Request Handling: When a process requests resources, the system temporarily pretends to grant the request and checks if this results in a safe state.
Allocation Check: If the system remains in a safe state after the allocation, the request is granted. Otherwise, it is denied to avoid deadlock.
Key Steps of the Algorithm:
Safety Check: The system checks whether granting the requested resources would still allow a safe sequence of execution for all processes.
Resource Request: If a process requests resources, the system first checks if the request is less than or equal to the available resources. If yes, it then performs the safety check.
Resource Allocation: If the safety check passes, the resources are allocated; otherwise, the request is denied.
Data Structures Used:
Available[]: Represents the number of available resources of each type.
Maximum[][]: Represents the maximum number of resources each process may need.
Allocation[][]: Represents the number of resources allocated to each process.
Need[][]: Represents the remaining resources required by each process (calculated as Need[i][j] = Maximum[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]).

Explanation of Code:
The is_safe_state function checks if the system is in a safe state after a resource request.
The request_resources function is used to simulate a resource request by a process. It checks if the request can be granted based on the current available resources and the Banker's Algorithm's safety check.
available: The available resources in the system.
maximum: The maximum resources each process can request.
allocation: The current allocation of resources to each process.
need: The remaining resources needed by each process to finish its execution.
Example Calculation:
Initial State:

Available = [3, 3, 2]

Maximum:

css
Copy code
[[7, 5, 3],
 [3, 2, 2],
 [9, 0, 2],
 [2, 2, 2],
 [4, 3, 3]]
Allocation:

css
Copy code
[[0, 1, 0],
 [2, 0, 0],
 [3, 0, 2],
 [2, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 2]]
Need = Maximum - Allocation:

css
Copy code
[[7, 4, 3],
 [1, 2, 2],
 [6, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 1],
 [4, 3, 1]]
Request by Process 1 = [1, 0, 2]:

Check if the request is valid: The request is within the need and available resources.
Simulate the allocation:
Available becomes [2, 3, 0] after allocating resources to Process 1.
Allocation becomes [[0, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2], ...] after the request.
Need is updated for Process 1.
The system is then checked for a safe state using the is_safe_state function. If the state is safe, the request is granted; otherwise, it is denied.

Output:
less
Copy code
Available resources: [3, 3, 2]
Maximum resources: [[7, 5, 3], [3, 2, 2], [9, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2], [4, 3, 3]]
Allocated resources: [[0, 1, 0], [2, 0, 0], [3, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2]]

Implementation of Linked, Indexed, and Contiguous File Allocation Methods
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to implement and demonstrate the three primary file allocation methods used in file systems: Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation, and Indexed Allocation. Each of these methods is designed to manage how files are stored in secondary storage and how they are accessed by the operating system.

Description of File Allocation Methods
1. Contiguous File Allocation
In Contiguous File Allocation, each file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on the disk. The starting block of the file is stored in the directory entry, and the length of the file is either fixed or variable. This allocation method is simple and fast because the blocks are contiguous, making it easier to calculate the file's location. However, it suffers from fragmentation issues over time.

Advantages:
Simple to implement.
Fast access to files due to contiguous blocks.
Disadvantages:
External fragmentation can occur as files grow and shrink.
Difficult to allocate large files in a fragmented disk.
2. Linked File Allocation
In Linked File Allocation, each file is stored as a linked list of blocks scattered throughout the disk. Each block contains a pointer to the next block of the file. The directory entry stores the address of the first block, and the rest of the blocks can be found by following the pointers.

Advantages:
No external fragmentation.
Can allocate any file size dynamically.
Disadvantages:
Slower access to files because the system must traverse the linked list to access the blocks.
Extra space for storing pointers.
3. Indexed File Allocation
In Indexed File Allocation, a special block, called the index block, is used to store pointers to the file's data blocks. The directory entry points to the index block, and the index block contains the addresses of all the blocks that make up the file.

Advantages:
No external fragmentation.
Random access to file blocks is possible.
Disadvantages:
Requires extra space for the index block.
Can suffer from internal fragmentation if the index block is not large enough to hold all the pointers.

file2 = File("file2", 4)  # 4 blocks

# Try to allocate the files using different methods
disk.allocate_contiguous(file1)
disk.allocate_linked(file2)
Explanation of Code:
Disk Class:

allocate_contiguous: Allocates contiguous blocks on the disk for a file.
allocate_linked: Allocates non-contiguous blocks for a file and links them.
allocate_indexed: Allocates a file with an index block and non-contiguous blocks for the file's data.
File Class:

Represents a file with a name, size, and list of blocks.
Example Files:

file1 is allocated using contiguous blocks.
file2 is allocated using linked allocation.
Example Calculation:
Assume we have a disk with 10 blocks, and we want to allocate two files:

File1 of size 3 blocks.

File2 of size 4 blocks.

Contiguous Allocation:

We try to allocate file1 starting at block 0 and it successfully gets allocated to blocks 0, 1, and 2.
Output: "Allocated file1 at blocks [0, 1, 2] (Contiguous Allocation)."
Linked Allocation:

We allocate file2 using non-contiguous blocks.
The file is allocated one block at a time, with the blocks linked.
Output: "Allocated block 3 to file2 (Linked Allocation)."
Output:
scss
Copy code
Allocated file1 at blocks [0, 1, 2] (Contiguous Allocation).
Allocated block 3 to file2 (Linked Allocation).
Output Analysis:
Contiguous Allocation: Efficient for accessing files but suffers from fragmentation.
Linked Allocation: Solves fragmentation issues but can lead to slower access time due to the need to traverse the linked list.
Indexed Allocation: Offers the ability for random access to blocks but may lead to additional overhead from index block management.
Conclusion:
The implementation of these three file allocation methods (Contiguous, Linked, and Indexed) demonstrates the trade-offs between access speed, space efficiency, and fragmentation. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which method to use depends on the specific requirements of the system.

Implementation of Socket Commands (socket, send, recv, bind, listen, accept, connect)
Aim
The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate how socket programming is used to establish communication between a client and server. This includes using commands such as socket(), send(), recv(), bind(), listen(), accept(), and connect() to send and receive data over a network.

Description of Socket Programming
Socket Programming is a way of enabling communication between two different processes on the same machine or on different machines over a network. A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. The most common usage of sockets involves a client-server model where:

Server: Waits for incoming client requests, accepts them, and processes them.
Client: Sends requests to the server and receives the response.
There are several important functions involved in socket programming, such as:

socket(): Creates a socket.
bind(): Binds the socket to a specific address and port.
listen(): Listens for incoming connection requests.
accept(): Accepts a connection from a client.
connect(): Connects a client to a server.
send(): Sends data from one socket to another.
recv(): Receives data from another socket.
Code: Implementation of Socket Commands
Server Code:
python
Copy code
import socket

# Creating the socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_socket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 12345))

# Listening for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)
print("Server is listening on port 12345...")

# Accept a connection from a client
client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection established with {client_address}")

# Receive data from the client
data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
print(f"Received data: {data}")

# Send a response back to the client
response = "Hello, Client!"
client_socket.send(response.encode('utf-8'))

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
Client Code:
python
Copy code
import socket

# Create a socket to connect to the server
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the server on localhost at port 12345
client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 12345))

# Send data to the server
client_socket.send("Hello, Server!".encode('utf-8'))

# Receive response from the server
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
print(f"Server response: {response}")

# Close the connection
client_socket.close()
Explanation of Code:
Server Code:

socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) creates an IPv4 TCP socket.
bind() binds the server socket to a specific IP address and port (127.0.0.1 on port 12345).
listen(5) listens for incoming connections, with a queue size of 5.
accept() waits for an incoming connection, and once a connection is made, it returns a new socket for communication with the client.
recv(1024) receives data (up to 1024 bytes) from the client.
send() sends a response back to the client.
close() is called to close the socket after communication is complete.
Client Code:

socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) creates an IPv4 TCP socket.
connect() establishes a connection to the server's address (127.0.0.1 on port 12345).
send() sends a message to the server.
recv(1024) receives the server's response.
close() closes the socket after communication.
Output:
Server Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Server is listening on port 12345...
Connection established with ('127.0.0.1', <random_port>)
Received data: Hello, Server!
Client Output:

arduino
Copy code
Server response: Hello, Client!
Output Analysis:
Server:

The server listens for incoming client connections on port 12345.
Once the client sends a message, the server receives the data, prints it, and sends a response back to the client.
After communication, the server closes the connection.
Client:

The client connects to the server at 127.0.0.1 on port 12345.
It sends a message to the server, receives the response, and then closes the connection.
The server and client are successfully able to communicate, demonstrating the usage of socket commands for creating a simple client-server application.

Conclusion:
In this experiment, the socket, send, recv, bind, listen, accept, and connect commands were used to create a basic client-server communication system. The client sent a message to the server, which processed it and sent a response back. This is a foundational concept in network programming and can be extended to build more complex communication systems.

ChatGPT
Viva Questions and Answers
1. Linux/Unix File-Related System Calls
Q1. What is the purpose of mkdir() system call?
A1. mkdir() is used to create a new directory. It takes the directory name and permission mode as arguments.

Q2. How is link() different from symlink()?
A2. link() creates a hard link, sharing the same inode, while symlink() creates a symbolic (soft) link that points to the target file's path.

Q3. Why is unlink() used?
A3. unlink() removes a file's link from the filesystem, effectively deleting it if no other links exist.

Q4. What is the difference between open() and read() system calls?
A4. open() is used to open a file and obtain a file descriptor, whereas read() is used to read data from a file using its descriptor.

2. Process-Related System Calls
Q1. What is the purpose of the fork() system call?
A1. fork() is used to create a new process (child) that is a copy of the parent process.

Q2. How can you differentiate between the parent and child processes in fork()?
A2. The fork() call returns 0 to the child process and the PID of the child to the parent process.

Q3. What does exec() do in a process?
A3. exec() replaces the current process image with a new one, effectively running a different program.

Q4. Explain the role of wait() in process synchronization.
A4. wait() makes the parent process wait until a child process completes execution, ensuring synchronization.

3. Shell Programming
Q1. How can you find the factorial of a number in a shell script?
A1. Use a loop or recursion to multiply the number by decremented values until reaching 1.

Q2. What command checks if a number is even or odd in shell?
A2. Use the modulus operator: [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ] checks for even; otherwise, it is odd.

Q3. How can you check if a number is a palindrome in shell?
A3. Reverse the number and compare it with the original using conditional statements.

4. CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Q1. Why is the Round Robin algorithm widely used?
A1. It is fair and provides time-sharing by giving each process a fixed time quantum.

Q2. How does SJF scheduling optimize performance?
A2. It minimizes the average waiting time by executing the shortest job first.

Q3. What is the disadvantage of FCFS scheduling?
A3. It may lead to the convoy effect, where short processes get delayed by longer processes.

5. Page Replacement Algorithms
Q1. Explain the FIFO page replacement algorithm.
A1. FIFO replaces the oldest page in memory when a page fault occurs.

Q2. Why is LRU more efficient than FIFO?
A2. LRU (Least Recently Used) replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time, which is a better approximation of optimal replacement.

Q3. What is a page fault?
A3. A page fault occurs when a process tries to access a page not currently in memory.

6. Threads
Q1. What are threads in a process?
A1. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space within a process but execute independently.

Q2. How is a thread different from a process?
A2. Threads share memory and resources, while processes have separate memory and resource allocation.

Q3. What is the advantage of using multithreading?
A3. It improves application performance by executing multiple tasks concurrently.

7. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
Q1. What are pipes in IPC?
A1. Pipes are a unidirectional communication channel that allows data transfer between processes.

Q2. How does shared memory work in IPC?
A2. Shared memory allows processes to access a common memory segment for direct communication.

Q3. Why is synchronization important in shared memory?
A3. Synchronization prevents data inconsistency caused by concurrent access.

8. Synchronization Problems
Q1. What is the Dining Philosopher Problem?
A1. It is a classical synchronization problem that demonstrates how processes can avoid deadlock when competing for shared resources (forks in this case).

Q2. How does the Producer-Consumer problem work?
A2. It involves a producer adding items to a buffer and a consumer removing them. Synchronization ensures that the buffer doesn't overflow or underflow.

Q3. What mechanisms solve synchronization issues?
A3. Semaphores, mutexes, and monitors are common mechanisms.

9. Banker's Algorithm
Q1. What is the main purpose of the Banker's Algorithm?
A1. To prevent deadlocks by ensuring that a system can safely allocate resources without running out.

Q2. What is a safe state in the Banker's Algorithm?
A2. A state where all processes can complete their execution without causing a deadlock.

Q3. How does the algorithm check for resource safety?
A3. It compares the need matrix with the available resources to simulate safe resource allocation.

10. File Allocation Methods
Q1. Explain the linked file allocation method.
A1. Files are stored as linked blocks, where each block points to the next. The last block has a special null pointer.

Q2. What is the main drawback of contiguous file allocation?
A2. It suffers from fragmentation and may require compaction to free up space.

Q3. How does indexed file allocation differ from linked allocation?
A3. Indexed allocation uses an index block to store pointers to all blocks of a file, removing the need for sequential traversal.

11. Socket Programming
Q1. What is the role of the bind() function in socket programming?
A1. bind() associates a socket with a specific IP address and port.

Q2. How does listen() work in a server program?
A2. It puts the server in a listening state, allowing it to accept incoming connections.

Q3. What is the difference between send() and recv()?
A3. send() is used to send data over a socket, while recv() is used to receive data.
